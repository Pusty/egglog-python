        "1. Install `egg-smol` Python\n",
        "2. Create a representation for matrices and some simplification rules for them. This will be based off of the [matrix multiplication example](https://github.com/mwillsey/egg-smol/blob/08a6e8f/tests/matrix.egg) in the egg-smol repository. By using our high level wrapper, we can rely on Python's built in static type checker to check the correctness of your representation.\n",
